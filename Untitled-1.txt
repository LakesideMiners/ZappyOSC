PRIME?

Prime - Prelubertaion of system with fluid medium





How does a spool work in a circuit work?

Spool valves regulate the flow of fluid in hydraulic systems. Spool valves would slide backward and forward so that the fluid flow can be either in one direction or another around a circuit of pipes. Spool valves have two basic components, a cylindrical barrel in which slides a plunger or spool

Centerifure pumps



tranment velocity via roating plate


Foreces water out via centriafl force force water out via cirucalr pattern


negative pressure obsersved at inlet


Preferced in hydruacls but only in certain senarearos





psotive displament pumps


commion in fluid power operations


prostive displacme pump refers to 
    Enclsoi9ng a fixed volume of fluid
    moveing it though a circute via Mechinal means
    Abalitly to decrese volume of fluid crical to operation
        high-low deintsy





flow meters


Help see what is going on in system, where is flow going, 

the "Words" of our system
not an overview, it tells the detials



Rotato metere
transparent Tube
pistion
fluid goes around the Tube
pushed up by fluid


Turbine- Type Flowmetere
more presice, but is more costly and more matince, 






Regualotore 
Penmunmaict

schematics 8 Rules


symbols may be roated/revered without loosing their emaning exxcpet tank/accumulators

unlimted amount of venting reservoirs may be placed insted of direct lines to thank

lines can only be drawn verticaly of horizontaly

must draw the specefted connecteion, crossed, uncroceed, blocked, etc

symbols show paths and position, nothing else

drawn to be interpreted in a de enegrized state


letters may be used for clartiy- not necesary

solid arrows indact hydruaic flow- unclodred/empty arrows indcate pneumtic flow


flow control vavlue to adjust how much prsure is going to to cincale
